* Size 0 = random
* debug() = setup a forced position
* advanced_setup = setup agent start as random or [1,1], number of arrows
* Agent always climb on [1,1] (?). To find it:
        - grid: guindance by bumps, find left+bottom corner
        - dodecahedron: need to check the level
        - OR: BETTER! Climb cave always have GLITTER (?)
        - Maybe: new perception: SEE LIGHT
* Agent can find arrows by GLITTER
* agent start at random cave
* hazard: bats. Move you to a random location
* New perception: HEAR FLAPS
* wumpus movement (stander, walker, runner)
* arrow can hit you back
* -500 points if could not climb out in time (starvation)
* restart :- agent has 3 lifes in the same world
* measure time (benchmark)

* new intelligent agent for dodecahedron
* new agent for grid that do not assume start position [1,1] and size

---

DONE:

- check_setup : does not fail, but return a default if wrong

- stander
- size: from 2 to 9, 
- gold: random quantity (probability 0.1), not in [1,1]
- pits: random quantity (probability 0.2), random location, not in [1,1], [2,1] and [1,2]
- wumpus: only one, random, (move at will - not yet), not started in [1,1]

- Make every room with 3 tunnels

- Scores:
  * 1000 points for each gold AFTER climbing alive
  * 500 points for killing the Wumpus
  * -500 for dying

- Enough with the grids! Lets see the original topology:
